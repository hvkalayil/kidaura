Internship Task<br/>
__NOTE__ Navigate to Screen Two using the button at the last page in Screen One.<br/>
__NOTE__ I have'nt done the unit testing.<br/>
I am new to automated testing. I never used it in any of my projects, but i believe its worth 
looking into, so I tried to write one. But its hard to do it without clearly understanding it.
